# Synthetic City Generation

This includes the scripts necessary for both the data generation and the training and testing of models.

### data_generation
These scripts primarily involve the creation of synthetic data by interfacing with CityEngine.

1. **dynamic_shoot_syn_1_colorful_city.py** is run from within CityEngine twice to create the raw synthetic data patches: once with the city fully rendered for the image data, and a second time with buildings rendered as black and other extraneous objects taken out for the label file.

2. **pre_process_syn.py** reads in a directory filled with the raw tiles and formats the labels for use in the training processes. It also creates a file *colTileNames.txt* so the model can read in the list of files.

3. **randomizer.py** is used if only a subset of patches generated are needed or if you need to remake *colTileNames.txt*.

4. **crop.py** is used on rela data from Inria as those tiles are 5000x5000 compared to DeepGlobe and synthetic tiles that are 572x572.


### experiments

1. **train_custom_threesources.py** pulls data from 3 separate sources in a 2:2:1 ratio for each mini batch and trains a model.

2. **test_custom_all.py** tests the above trained model on real images.

3. **iou.py** calculates either a pure average or weighted IoU for a given output result file from testing.
